We use ODF Validator [1] for ODF export validation and officeotron [2] for OOXML export validation.

Both tools should be available through a wrapper script that is in the path and is called officeotron respectively
odfvalidator and should have a form similar to the ones of the two scripts in this directory.

Use the 'setup.sh' script in this directory if you want to set them up automatically.
